An array list stores objects in contiguous memory so whenever you need to add or remove an item from an array list, it is a complex operation that involves shifting many items in the list. However, accessing items in an array list is easy because they are indexed.
A linked list is made up of nodes with data and pointers to other nodes. Inserting or removing an element is much more efficient than an array list because you can merely shift the node pointers. However, traversing and accessing elements in a linked list is more complex. You have to go through the linked list node by node to arrive at the desired node.
