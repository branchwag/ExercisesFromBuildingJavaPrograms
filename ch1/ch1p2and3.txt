convert these decimal nums to binary

6 -> 110 (a 4 and 2)
44 -> 101100 (a 32, 0, 8, 4)
72 -> 1001000 (a 64)
131 -> 10000011 (a 128, a 2, and a 1 - remember the rightmost is 2 to 0 which is 1)



//we seem to start at 0 in programming bc each bit (binary digit) corresponds to exponent of 2, starting at 2^0 for rightmost bit
//bit shifting can make more sense this way


converting binary to decimal

100 = 4
1011 = 2 + 1 + 16 = 19
101010 = 2 + 8 + 32 = 42 :)
1001110 = 64 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 78
