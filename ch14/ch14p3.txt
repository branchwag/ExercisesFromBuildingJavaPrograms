When you call `push` on a stack:
- The new element is placed on top of the stack, above all other existing elements
- It becomes the newest element in the stack

When you call `pop` on a stack:
- The element at the top of the stack is removed and returned
- This is the most recently added element (the newest one)
- This follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle

This is why stacks are described as LIFO data structures - the last element you put in is the first one you get out when removing elements.
