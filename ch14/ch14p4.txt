When you call `add` on a queue:
- The new element is placed at the back (or rear/tail) of the queue, behind all other existing elements
- It becomes the newest element in the queue

When you call `remove` on a queue:
- The element at the front (or head) of the queue is removed and returned
- This is the oldest element in the queue (the one that was added earliest)
- This follows the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle

This is why queues are described as FIFO data structures - the first element you put in is the first one you get out when removing elements.
