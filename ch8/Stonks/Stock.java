/* It would be useful to have a few other methods in our Stock objects. For
example, it would be good to implement accessors for the Stock â€™s data (the
symbol, number of shares, and so on), and a toString method to easily
print Stock objects. We could even add a second constructor that would
accept an initial number of shares and cost. These features are left for you
to implement as exercises.
